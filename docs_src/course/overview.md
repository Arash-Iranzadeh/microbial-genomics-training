# Course Overview

## About the Course

This comprehensive 10-day training course introduces participants to the core principles and practical applications of microbial genomics and metagenomics in clinical and public health contexts.

## Target Pathogens

Using real-world datasets, participants will analyze:

- **_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_** - TB genomics and drug resistance
- **_Vibrio cholerae_** - Outbreak investigation and epidemiology  
- **_Escherichia coli_** - Pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance
- **_Shigella sonnei_** - Genomic surveillance and typing

## Key Focus Areas

### Genomic Analysis
- Analyze genomic diversity and evolutionary relationships
- Investigate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles
- Study mobile genetic elements (MGE) in resistance spread

### Metagenomics
- Explore microbial communities in clinical and environmental samples
- Apply advanced sequencing analysis techniques
- Interpret complex metagenomic datasets

### Reproducible Workflows
- Master version control with Git
- Work with containerized environments (Docker/Singularity)
- Implement Nextflow pipelines for scalable analysis

## Course Format

- **Interactive workshops** with hands-on exercises
- **Real-world datasets** from clinical and surveillance studies
- **Expert instruction** from experienced genomics researchers
- **Group projects** and individual presentations
- **Bring-your-own-data** analysis sessions

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this course, participants will be equipped with practical skills to conduct genomic surveillance, investigate outbreaks, and contribute to public health decision-making through genomic analysis.
