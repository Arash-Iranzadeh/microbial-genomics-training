# Course Overview

## About the Course

This comprehensive 10-day training course introduces participants to the core principles and practical applications of microbial genomics and metagenomics in clinical and public health contexts.

## Course Schedule (September 1-12, 2025)

The training covers 10 days of intensive hands-on learning:

### Week 1: Foundations
- **Day 1**: Course welcome, genomic surveillance, sequencing technologies, PubMLST
- **Day 2**: HPC introduction, command line, quality control, species identification  
- **Day 3**: Genome assembly, annotation, MLST, serotyping, AMR detection
- **Day 4**: Comparative genomics, pangenomics, phylogenomics
- **Day 5**: Metagenomic profiling and microbiome analysis

### Week 2: Advanced Applications
- **Day 6**: Co-infection detection, variant calling, genotype-phenotype correlation
- **Day 7**: Nextflow workflow development and nf-core
- **Day 8**: Advanced pipeline development and optimization
- **Day 9**: Bring-your-own-data analysis session
- **Day 10**: Final presentations and course wrap-up

## Target Pathogens

Using real-world datasets, participants will analyze:

- **_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_** - TB genomics and drug resistance
- **_Vibrio cholerae_** - Outbreak investigation and epidemiology  
- **_Escherichia coli_** - Pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance
- **_Shigella sonnei_** - Genomic surveillance and typing

## Key Focus Areas

### Genomic Analysis
- Analyze genomic diversity and evolutionary relationships
- Investigate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles
- Study mobile genetic elements (MGE) in resistance spread

### Metagenomics
- Explore microbial communities in clinical and environmental samples
- Apply advanced sequencing analysis techniques
- Interpret complex metagenomic datasets

### Reproducible Workflows
- Master version control with Git
- Work with containerized environments (Docker/Singularity)
- Implement Nextflow pipelines for scalable analysis

## Course Format

- **Interactive workshops** with hands-on exercises
- **Real-world datasets** from clinical and surveillance studies
- **Expert instruction** from experienced genomics researchers
- **Group projects** and individual presentations
- **Bring-your-own-data** analysis sessions

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this course, participants will be equipped with practical skills to conduct genomic surveillance, investigate outbreaks, and contribute to public health decision-making through genomic analysis.
